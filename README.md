# Parkerino

Parkerino is sample android project for car park management for employees.
I worked on GUI and login, sign up management. It is working extremely good.

## Problems to be solved

Need to fix background in the management screen.
Boxes of park areas' colors don't change after employee adds car on that area.
Boxes needs to be locked after employee adds car.


## Future works
Planning to solve problems.
Adding the status for areas to lock/unlock
Adding searching box for car to get its info
